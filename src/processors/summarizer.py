        "❌ WRONG: 'Congressional Award reauth → 3/10 because it's just a resolution about a program'\n"
        "✅ RIGHT: 'Congressional Award reauth → 8/10 because teens participate in the program as members'\n"
        "**Rule:** If bill reauthorizes/funds a program with teen participants, it's 8-10 (direct).\n\n"
        
        "**Mistake 2: Scoring symbolic resolutions too high**\n"
        "❌ WRONG: 'PCOS Awareness Month → 7/10 because PCOS affects women and teens are women'\n"
        "✅ RIGHT: 'PCOS Awareness Month → 3/10 because it only raises awareness, creates no programs or funding'\n"
        "**Rule:** Awareness months/days without programs or funding cap at 4.\n\n"
        
        "**Mistake 3: Treating indirect impact as direct**\n"
        "❌ WRONG: 'Child tax credit → 9/10 because teens are in families that receive it'\n"
        "✅ RIGHT: 'Child tax credit → 6/10 because parents receive it, teens benefit indirectly through household income'\n"
        "**Rule:** If teens don't personally interact with the program/service, it's indirect (5-7).\n\n"
        
        "**Mistake 4: Confusing scope with directness**\n"
        "❌ WRONG: 'School renovation in 20% of districts → 5/10 because only some teens benefit'\n"
        "✅ RIGHT: 'School renovation in 20% of districts → 8/10 because affected teens directly experience renovated schools'\n"
        "**Rule:** Score based on NATURE of impact (direct/indirect/symbolic), not NUMBER of teens affected.\n\n"
        
        "**Mistake 5: Overscoring indirect family benefits**\n"
        "❌ WRONG: 'Parent job training program → 8/10 because better parent jobs help teens'\n"
        "✅ RIGHT: 'Parent job training program → 6/10 because teens benefit indirectly through family economic stability'\n"

        "   Examples: Congressional Award, 4-H, youth programs, after-school programs, summer jobs programs\n"
        "   → YES → 8-10 (direct impact on participants)\n"
        "   → NO → Continue to step 3\n\n"
        
        "3️⃣ **Do teens personally interact with what this bill changes?**\n"
        "   Ask: Do teens use the service, attend the space, experience the restriction, or access the resource?\n"
        "   Examples: Use the app, eat the lunch, attend the school, apply for the loan, work under the law\n"
