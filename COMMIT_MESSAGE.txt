fix: Comprehensive workflow stabilization and dev environment fixes

This commit implements a robust set of fixes to stabilize the orchestrator workflow, eliminate errors in the CI environment, and resolve local development setup issues.

### Key Changes:

1.  **CI API-Only Mode:**
    *   Introduced a CI detection helper that forces the workflow into an "API-only" mode when running in GitHub Actions.
    *   This completely disables all HTML scraping (feed parsing, tracker scraping, text fallbacks) in the CI environment, which permanently resolves the persistent 403 Forbidden errors from Congress.gov.
    *   The `.github/workflows/daily.yml` file has been updated to explicitly enable this mode.

2.  **Duplicate Bill Processing Fix:**
    *   Added logic to the orchestrator to deduplicate the list of incoming bills by their normalized `bill_id` before processing. This resolves the issue of the same bill being checked multiple times in the logs.

3.  **Tweet Safety Guardrails:**
    *   Implemented safety checks in the orchestrator to prevent test or placeholder content from being tweeted.
    *   Created a `scripts/cleanup_test_bills.py` script to remove any existing test data from the production database.
    *   Test scripts now have a safeguard to prevent them from running against a production database.

4.  **Development Environment Fixes:**
    *   Resolved the `greenlet` build failure on macOS with Python 3.13 by moving `playwright` to `requirements-dev.txt` and pinning compatible versions.
    *   Updated the `scripts/dev.sh` script to handle optional installation of browser dependencies, making the local setup more flexible and robust.

These changes ensure the daily workflow is reliable, the logs are clean, the production environment is protected from test data, and the local development setup is functional.
