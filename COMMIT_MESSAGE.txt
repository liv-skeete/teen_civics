Implement feed-based workflow with full text validation

This commit implements the new workflow that waits for full bill text
before summarizing, based on the architectural design in
NEW_WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md.

## Major Changes

### New Features
- Add feed parser for Congress.gov "Bill Texts Received Today" feed
- Implement text validation to ensure bills have full text (min 100 chars)
- Add version tracking for bill texts
- Enhance duplicate prevention with bill_already_posted() function

### Database Updates
- Add new fields: text_source, text_version, text_received_date, processing_attempts
- Create migration script with rollback capability
- Add indexes for performance optimization
- Successfully migrated production database

### Code Enhancements
- Update congress_fetcher.py with feed-based processing
- Add download_bill_text() function for direct URL downloads
- Update orchestrator.py with text validation logic
- Improve error handling and logging throughout

### Bug Fixes
- Fix missing bill_already_posted import in orchestrator
- Add lxml parser to fix BeautifulSoup XML warnings
- Add User-Agent headers to prevent 403 errors from Congress.gov
- Add PyMuPDF dependency for PDF text extraction

### Testing & Documentation
- Add comprehensive test suite (tests/test_feed_parser.py)
- Update GitHub Actions schedule to 11:00 UTC (8:00 AM ET)
- Update workflow name to reflect feed-based processing

### Dependencies Added
- lxml==5.1.0 (XML/HTML parsing)
- PyMuPDF==1.24.0 (PDF text extraction)
