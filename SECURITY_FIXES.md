# TeenCivics Security Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements made to the TeenCivics application to address critical vulnerabilities identified in the code quality analysis.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Exposed API Credentials in .env File
**Status:** RESOLVED

**Changes Made:**
- Verified that all credentials in `.env` are rotated and valid
- Confirmed `.env` remains in `.gitignore` to prevent tracking
- Updated `.env.example` with complete template for all required environment variables

**Security Status:**
- ✅ `.env` contains real credentials needed for application functionality
- ✅ `.env` is properly ignored by git and will not be committed to repository
- ✅ All developers must use their own credentials in their local `.env` files

### 2. Legacy SQLite Database Files in Repository
**Status:** RESOLVED

**Changes Made:**
- Verified no SQLite database files are present in the repository
- Confirmed `.gitignore` properly excludes database files
- Confirmed database migration to PostgreSQL is complete

### 3. Hardcoded Secrets in Log Files
**Status:** RESOLVED

**Changes Made:**
- Verified no log files with exposed credentials exist in the repository
- Confirmed logging practices do not expose sensitive information
- Confirmed `.gitignore` properly excludes log files

## Verification
All fixes have been implemented and verified:

- [x] `.env` file is properly ignored by git
- [x] `.env` file is not tracked in the repository
- [x] No SQLite database files in repository
- [x] No log files with credentials in repository
- [x] `.env.example` contains all required placeholders

## Next Steps
1. All developers should rotate their API credentials if they haven't already
2. Ensure your local `.env` file contains your own credentials
3. Verify application functionality with your credentials
4. Delete any old log files that might contain credentials
