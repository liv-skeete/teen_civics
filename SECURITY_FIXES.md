# Security Fixes for Database Credentials Exposure

## Issue Summary

Database credentials were accidentally committed to the git repository in migration-related scripts. These files contained hardcoded database connection strings, which posed a security risk.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Scripts to Use Environment Variables

All scripts have been modified to read database connection strings from environment variables instead of hardcoding them. The primary variable used is `DATABASE_URL`.

### 2. Updated `.env.example`

The `.env.example` file has been updated to provide a clear template for the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

### 3. Git History Rewrite

A script at `scripts/secure_git_history.sh` was used to remove the sensitive files from the git history.

## Recommended Security Actions

### 1. Rotate Database Credentials

If you have not already done so, you should rotate your Railway database password immediately.

### 2. Update Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file and your Railway deployment's environment variables are updated with the new, rotated credentials.

### 3. Git History Integrity

The git history has been cleaned, but it is good practice to ensure that no sensitive information remains in the repository.

## Future Prevention

### 1. Add to `.gitignore`

Consider adding sensitive file patterns to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Ignore files with database credentials
*credentials*.py
*migration*temp*.py
```

### 2. Pre-commit Hooks

Set up pre-commit hooks to scan for sensitive information:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Add to .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
    rev: v1.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: detect-secrets
```

### 3. Environment Variable Validation

Add environment variable validation to scripts:

```python
# Always validate environment variables
DATABASE_URL = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
if not DATABASE_URL:
    raise ValueError("DATABASE_URL environment variable is required")
```

## Verification

After completing all security fixes:

- [ ] Database credentials have been rotated.
- [ ] Git history has been cleaned.
- [ ] Remote repository has been updated.
- [ ] All collaborators have updated their local repositories.
- [ ] Scripts work with environment variables.
- [ ] No sensitive information remains in the repository.
